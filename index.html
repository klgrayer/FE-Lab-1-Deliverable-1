<h1>Keyon Grayer</h1>
  
<p class="welcome">First off let me say thank you for visiting. I’m interested in learning new skills and this is my attempt to demonstrate some basic CSS and HTML knowledge. I hope this site will become a testament to the value of a Grand Circus boot camp and to the value I can offer an organization. Let me go into a little bit about myself. I was born and raised in the metro Detroit area. I believe in the power of this city and the people who make it great. I graduated from The University of Michigan in 2011 and due to my love for Detroit I knew this is where I wanted to be. From working at Quicken Loans I’ve seen firsthand that perseverance, hard work and curiosity is a recipe for success. I hope to apply that same recipe to web design and make the world around me better.</p>
